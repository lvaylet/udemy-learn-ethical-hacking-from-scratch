## WiFi Bands - 2.4Ghz & 5 Ghz Frequencies

`airodump-ng` only displays networks whose frequency band is supported by the wireless adapter, as displayed by `iwconfig`.

Use `airodump-ng --band a $IFACE` to sniff packets on 5Ghz.

Capture packets on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz frequencies by specifying multiple bands with `airodump-ng --band abg $IFACE`. Note that this requires a compatible wireless adapter, as well as more power and more resources.
