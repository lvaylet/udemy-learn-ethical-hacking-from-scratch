## What is MAC Address & How To Change It

Use `ifconfig` to display the MAC addresses of all the network interfaces.

The `ether` field displays the MAC address.

Change the MAC address temporarily with:

```
IFACE=wlan1
ifconfig $IFACE down
ifconfig $IFACE hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
ifconfig $IFACE up
```

Just make sure your address starts with `00` and confirm with `ifconfig`.

Note that your network manager might reset the MAC address.
