## Wireless Modes (Managed & Monitor)

Run `iwconfig` to display the wireless interfaces only, as well as their current mode.

First disable the wireless interface with:
```
IFACE=wlan1
ifconfig $IFACE down
```

Kill any process that could interfere with `Monitor` mode with:
```
airmon-ng check kill
````

Switch to `Monitor` mode with:
```
iwconfig $IFACE mode monitor
ifconfig $IFACE up
```

Confirm with:
```
iwconfig
```
